=============================================================

About
-----

San Andreas' Finest is a community based on civilian life role-play with extensively trained emergency services. We aim to give the best experience to all members. Here at SA'F we're not just a community, but a family as well. Everyone has a chance to make a difference.

The Team
--------
San Andreas' Finest is looking for fresh development talent, ready to move the community forward in new and exciting ways. At this moment in time, we're primarily in need of Programmers, but we're always looking out for MLO/EUP/Vehicle developers, designers, modellers, etc. If that's something you'd be interested in then fill in the form below!
